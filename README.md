# Quadcopter Flight Controller

This is the final version of the quadcopter flight controller software project.
The project is written for Arduino board and C++ and is designed to control the flight of quadcopters.

## Project Overview

The quadcopter flight controller software is responsible for managing the flight behavior of quadcopters. It includes the main controller logic that handles the stabilization, control, and navigation of the quadcopter.

## Project Structure

Now the project folder includes only one file which is main flight controller logic.

In addition to the main controller logic, the project also involves other setup and calibration files for different components.
However, these files are not included in the project folder as they are not essential for understanding the flight controller logic.

## How to Use

Before attempting to use the quadcopter flight controller code, it is important to calibrate all the components, such as the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and electronic speed controllers (ESCs).

Additionally, you will need to modify the code according to the specific Arduino board you are using, such as Uno or Mega. This may involve changing pin numbers and other hardware-related configurations to match your setup.

Once you have completed the calibration and made the necessary code modifications, you can upload the code to your Arduino board and power on the quadcopter.

Please note that proper understanding of the flight controller logic and experience with quadcopter flight is recommended before attempting to use the sketch.
